        <h2>2021 YTD Raymond National Account P/L Analysis</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this analysis is to identify, categorize, and quantify the causes of pricing discrepancies 
            between the invoiced amount in Quipware against the amount Raymond is paying. This analysis provides 
            insight on opportunities to improve our invoicing accuracy with the end goal of Raymond National Accounts
            having no financial impact on the overall P/L.
